","Our “In vivo” methodology was extremely demand-
ing on a geographical network setting, like 3G, that is not under
our control. In fact, we were able to repeat only a limited number
of experiments because of several unavoidable limitations.

- Also, several timeouts were incurred
in the experiments, due to intermittent network connections. Al-
though we tried other 3G providers (Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA
and H3G S.p.A Communication Networks), we were not able to
find a steady connection that allowed our very intensive commu-
nication pattern. Unfortunately, the area where the laboratory was
placed (with hard-to-move equipment) was not very well covered
by 3G providers.

Nevertheless, we have some positive results to
show, in spite of the limitations incurred by our setting.

Moreover, since our setup may have quirks specific to
the chosen device, it would be interesting to analyze the energy
consumption of multiple devices. Additionally, it could be interest-
ing to compare the energy footprint of Web components both on
Android and iOS platforms.

about the reliability of the implementation of the interventions
because their source code was developed collaboratively by

several code reviews. A number of wanted interventions were
unable to succeed, while these would have likely improved

between desktop and mobile devices, and (iii) conduct a user

helps us leverage the browser’s programmability, which is

- In future work, we plan to compare the differences of
client-side cache performance between mobile and desktop
website versions when accessing them on mobile devices.

- A threat to validity is the size of our dataset. In our
dataset, we have the 51 websites from Alexa’s Top 100 list
and the 91 websites randomly chosen from Alexa’s Top
1,000,000 list. The total number of websites may not be
large enough to represent the average situation, leading to
conclusions that may not be generalizable.

- We consider only the home page (or the landing page)
for each website. The home page is the first view that users
can see when they visit a website. So Web developers have
to make a lot of efforts to optimize their home page for
fast and efficient page load.

- Our study excludes the websites transferred via the
HTTPS protocol. However, it is a big trend that more and
more websites, especially their mobile versions, are being
migrated from HTTP to HTTPS for enhancing security. Ex-
cluding HTTPS may neglect some valuable findings. At the
(problem is that https is encrypted and thus can not be captured by their used tools).

-Our data collection lasted for only one week so that we
can report the cache performance with only less than 24-
hour revisiting interval

-Our measurement targets at the client-side cache mech-
anism, so we assume that the proxy used in our framework
can intercept all resources fetched from Web server. It is
possible to obtain different measurement results by using
other proxies than Charles. We plan to compare the impacts
introduced by different proxies in future work","low generalizability, measurement errors"

needing constant human supervision.

Unfortunately, popu-
lar automation tools only support the most popular browsers
on any given platform and as such cannot be used to evaluate
the multitude of browsers that are available on mobile devices.
In order to build a testbed that works for different kinds
of browsers, we require a more general approach that is not
dependent on a single browser’s features. Our idea is to use a
browser-agnostic testing framework to install different mobile
browsers, under different Android versions, automatically visit

Replaying recorded pages is not a straightforward task
particularly when dealing with HTTPS Web sites. To convince
the evaluated browsers to accept the self-signed certificates
presented by the proxy, we had to add a new root Certificate

repeated for every tested mobile device and, for the browsers

- end-user experience is strongly correlated with the device of the
end-user [24, 43], especially for web browsing. Our design aims to
remove device bias and capture a wide geographical footprint with
one single type of device.

- We use commercial-grade mobile subscriptions for our measure-
ments. While this represents what end customer can get, we do
not know which specific configuration each MBB operator is using
for each of these (e.g., in terms of QoS, or presence of proxies com-
monly found in MBB networks [36]). As such, our results do not
generalize all possible subscriptions, nor in different locations.

- he differences in commercial offers reflect in the different data
quota which in turn affects the dataset we can collect. We explicitly
opted to limit the number of pages in our tests and prefer several
repetitions of the same test to obtain a large dataset where we can
obtain statistically significant results for each page. Completing a
single experimentation takes about 2 hours, making it impossible
to cover more pages.

The disparities in the number of samples we could collect from
each node stem from the way the MONROE scheduler assigns
experiments to the nodes based on their available monthly data quota.

The RUMSpeedIndex represents a client-side approach for mea-
suring the Speed Index metric using Real User Monitoring (RUM).
Though this metric is appropriate for our experimental setup and
goes along the idea of the original Speed Index metric of measuring
how much of the ""above-the-fold"" content is visually complete until
the web page has finished loading, it also has a series of limitations.
Specifically, it only works for browsers that support Resource Tim-
ings, it does not handle content within iframes and does better for
Chrome which supports reporting a ""first paint"" event.","low generalizability, limitations of used metrics"

the set of mobile devices used in the experiment to two
specific devices (i.e., LG G2 and the Nexus 6P), potentially
impacting the generalization of our results to the whole set of
Android devices.

- Since it is arguably infeasible to reliably
perform real-life tests on all of the PWAs,we had to make a
selection. Given the fact that the scope of our experiment is
mobile web development, we decided to focus only on cate-
gories of network intensive PWAs such as shopping or news,
and disregard the ones that use specific phone hardware (e.g.
QR code scanners, voice recorders) since arguably it would be
difficult to implement those using traditional web technologies
and service workers play a relatively secondary role in them.
This could disable us from generalizing our conclusions to
the full population of existing PWAs, but we decided to make
such a decision since it gives more insights to comparison
between traditional web apps and PWAs.

- PWAs have only recently been introduced and
that programming techniques used in development in this first
batch of PWAs might not utilize the potential of PWAs to the
fullest

- The lab environment has the consequence of applying the treatments in
an artificial way which might not accurately represent the in-
the-wild treatment effects. Firstly, we applied the 2G network
conditions treatment by accurately simulating the latency and
bandwidth of average 2G connection. However, on mobile
devices different chips (different radios) take care of WiFi and
cellular connections. This might have had a small effect on the
energy consumption of a device.Another treatment that may
have an effect on PWAs is disabling the service worker",low generalizability

mitigate this threat, we used a relatively modern mobile device and
connected it via WiFi - a usual setting when users browse PWAs.
We used the Mozilla Firefox browser, as it was not possible to install
a different version of Google Chrome on our mobile device since it
was branded by Google and the installed version of Chrome on the
device was not suitable for the experiment

- Measurement of page load only. In this study we inves-
tigated only the loading of PWAs, i.e., we collected measures within
the time span ranging from the first HTTP GET request to the tar-
geted subject and its full load (proxied by the triggering of the load
event). The rationale for this decision is to have a fully control-
lable environment with objectively-measurable metrics. However,
if a subject is using a network-first caching strategy, it is possible
that the impact of caching could reveal itself only when the user
is accessing some specific functionalities, potentially leading to
completely different results. As a future work, we are planning to
expand this study in order to execute realistic usage scenarios for each subject in each run of the experiment, instead of focussing on
page load only.

- Naturally, to
achieve even more accurate results in future replications of the
experiment, the number of subjects can be increased by redoing
the subjects selection phase of our study, while being able to fully
reuse our measurement infrastructure.

- Moreover, we are planning to
carry out other follow-up studies focussing on the impact of (i)
different caching strategies (e.g., network-first, cache-first, etc.), (ii)
different and more realistic network conditions - instead of Wifi
only, and (iii) the type and amount of I/O operations performed
behind the lines by the browser.
